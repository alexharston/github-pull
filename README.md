# github-pull

A small script for pulling all of your GitHub repositories when setting a up a new machine, because I'm tired of doing it manually.

> **_Note:_** this is designed to pull the first 100 repos a user may have (100 being GitHub's limit before pagination). If you have over 100 repos, then a) you need to get your life together, and b) you can probably do this better than I can.
